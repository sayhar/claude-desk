# Outreach and Relationship Building

**Inspired by:** Outreach principles from Albert Alexander (https://www.linkedin.com/in/albert-alexander-b6947b5/)
**Purpose:** Framework for building relationships with new people through direct outreach

## Core Principles

### What Works

**Intermediaries and gatekeepers: Low ROI**
- Cold outreach to people whose job is filtering you out rarely works

**People doing the actual work: High ROI**
- Direct outreach to people making decisions or doing work you're interested in
- Mix of learning + opportunity finding

### Reaching Out to Leaders

**Reach out to people in leadership roles directly**
- Leaders get direct outreach regularly -- it's expected and often appreciated
- Shows initiative and social fearlessness
- Works across domains: business, research, open source, community

**Outcomes when reaching out to leaders:**
- Some will redirect you to formal channels
- Many are open to a conversation first
- **It never hurts, and sometimes it can clinch the opportunity**

### Reaching Out to Peers

**Reach out to people already doing the work you're interested in**
- Great source of information about what the work is actually like
- Shared interests create natural alignment
- Easier with a mutual connection or hook, but not required

### The Underlying Asset

**"Most folks don't show that level of initiative or social fearlessness and it is an asset in practically every role."**

The willingness to reach out cold, to be curious, to ask -- this is itself valuable and differentiating. It's not just a tactic for a specific goal. It's a skill that matters in the work itself, whether that's business development, research collaboration, partnerships, or community building.

### Message Framing

**Great approach:**
> "Hey this looks like a great fit, I'd love to hear more about the types of problems you want to solve / direction you want to go. Would you be up for a quick chat about it?"

**Why this works:**
- People often welcome the opportunity to bounce things off a fresh brain
- Even if nothing formal comes out of it, the conversation can be mutually valuable
- Frames it as collaborative exploration, not a one-sided ask

**Adapt to context:** The exact wording changes depending on domain (research, business, open source, etc.), but the structure stays the same -- express genuine interest in their work, propose a lightweight next step.
