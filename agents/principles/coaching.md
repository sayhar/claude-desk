## Core Concepts

### Finding Real Edges

Agency isn't about grinding harder - it's about finding edges others avoid because they're annoying or unpleasant.

> "Radical agency is about finding real edges: things you are willing to do that others aren't, often because they're annoying or unpleasant. These don't always surface in awareness to the point one is actually choosing -- often they live in a cloud of aversion that strategically obscures the tradeoff."

> "All of my agency hacks are kind of like this, in my opinion -- big, glaring edges that people might rather ignore."

The edges are often hiding in discomfort you're avoiding.

### Court Rejection

If you're only asking for things you get, you're not aiming high enough. Rejection is a signal you're calibrating correctly.

> "Ask for things that feel unreasonable, to make sure your intuitions about what's reasonable are accurate (of course, try not to be a jerk in the process). If you're only asking for things you get, you're not aiming high enough."

> "I sent an email recently that I wouldn't have dared try a few years ago, something along the lines of 'I'm planning to start an organization similar to yours; would you consider letting me run yours instead?' The response? Crickets. Maybe that person thinks I overstepped. But it doesn't matter, because a similar pitch delivered to someone else put us on a path to start a new organization together, something much cooler than I could have managed on my own."

Learn to decouple "no" from self-worth. The goal is recalibration, not validation.

### Moat of Low Status

Making changes requires crossing a period where you're actually bad at the thing. This period protects against competition - most people won't cross it.

> "The moat of low status is one of my favorite concepts, courtesy of my husband Sasha. The idea is that making changes in your life, especially when learning new skill sets, requires you to cross a moat of low status, a period of time where you are actually bad at the thing or fail to know things that are obvious to other people."

> "It's called a moat both because you can't just leap to the other side and because it gives anyone who can cross it a real advantage. It's possible to cross the moat quietly, by not asking questions and not collaborating, but those tradeoffs really nerf learning."

The willingness to look stupid while learning is a competitive advantage.

### Surface Area for Luck

You can't predict which conversations will be useful. Relevance is not a good proxy for usefulness. Cast a wide net.

> "What I discovered by casting a wide net was that I have very little ability to predict how useful a call will be in advance. Relevance is easier to predict, but it's not a very good proxy for usefulness, which is a product of lots of other things including the other person's enthusiasm and the breadth of their interests."

> "Nearly all of my most fruitful collaborations over the last 3 years have come out of meetings I booked almost at random. My best conversation last week was with someone where the introducer told me 'this person asked for an introduction but I'm not sure it's a good use of your time.'"

Meet broadly. The best opportunities come from unexpected places.

### Assume Everything is Learnable

Most traits people treat as fixed are actually malleable if you believe they are and put in the work.

> "Many (most?) traits that people treat as fixed are actually quite malleable if you (1) believe they are and (2) put the same kind of work into learning them as you would anything else."

> "Some other things you can learn: confidence, charisma, warmth, tranquility, optimism. Someone recently asked me how one might go about learning charisma, and the answer was really boring: by reading a few books, watching many hours of charismatic people interacting with others, and adopting a few of their habits."

Whatever it is, assume it can be learned. The task is figuring out how.

### Burnout Kills Agency

Grinding kills creativity and strategic thinking. Reduction in agency is often the first sign of burnout.

> "The reality is that grinding, even if it temporarily increases output, kills creativity and big picture thinking. Burnout is the ultimate agency-killer."

> "This is so true that I've learned to identify a reduction in agency as one of the first signs of burnout, one that shows up even before I consciously realize what's happening. A switch flips and I start looking for ways to rule out ideas and actions, to conclude they won't work or aren't necessary, rather than chasing better versions."

> "My rule is never to take instructions on how hard I should work from someone who hasn't burned out before. Very few people take this seriously enough."

Sustainable intensity isn't optional - it's how you preserve agency.

- Decisions with unclear "right answer"
- When noticing avoidance patterns
- Strategic planning and opportunity assessment
- Burnout detection and prevention

## Note on Applications

This document contains the framework only. When you notice these concepts applying to the principal's situation, extract observations to your role's working files when you notice these patterns applying. Fresh eyes see the framework differently. Don't cache interpretations.
