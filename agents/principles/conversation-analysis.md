**Date:** January 2026
**Context:** Framework for analyzing any conversation strategically
**Application:** Use when helping the principal understand conversations, draft responses, or strategize outreach

## Core Framework

Analyze conversations strategically -- like a game with moves, not just content exchange.

### Before Drafting a Response

**1. Moves made so far**
- What has each party done in this conversation?
- What's the arc of the relationship?
- How has the dynamic shifted?

**2. Moves the other person just made**
- What are they signaling?
- What are they NOT saying?
- What door did they open or close?
- How does their communication style work? (length, formality, topics)

**3. Available moves**
- What can the principal do next?
- What options exist beyond the obvious response?
- What would be surprising/creative?

**4. Best moves and why**
- Which moves advance the principal's goals?
- Which match the other person's style and energy?
- Which build the relationship vs. extract value?
- Which create forward momentum vs. close doors?

**5. Missing moves**
- What is the principal NOT doing that they could be?
- What would add value beyond just responding?
- What demonstrates credibility vs. just claims it?
- What offers reciprocity vs. just asks?

## Common Patterns to Watch

### Energy mismatch
- If the principal writes 300 words and they write 100, they're over-investing
- Match their energy level, don't exceed it significantly

### Signal vs. noise
- Identify THE move that matters (opportunity, intro offer, credibility test)
- Don't let philosophical tangents bury the strategic signal

### Testing
- When someone probes your credibility, they're deciding whether to invest
- Show don't tell - demonstrate depth, don't just discuss it

### Door opening
- "We're planning to..." / "That could be interesting" = door opening
- Don't rush through it desperately, but don't ignore it either
- Express interest + stay in touch

### Peer vs. supplicant
- Are you conversing as equals or positioning yourself below them?
- Offering value/collaboration = peer. Only asking = supplicant.

## Application Notes

This framework is especially useful for:
- Multi-message threads where relationships develop over time
- Conversations that could lead to opportunities
- High-stakes outreach (investors, decision-makers, potential collaborators)
- Understanding why a conversation went well or poorly

**Remember:** The goal isn't to manipulate. It's to be strategic about building genuine relationships that serve both parties.
